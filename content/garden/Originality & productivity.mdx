# Originality & productivity

Letting tasks and commitments mature for a little bit before jumping in gives you time for thinking in nonlinear ways, for considering divergent ideas and for making unexpected leaps.As Adam Grant says: 

- ###   “To be **original** you don’t have to be first. You just have to be different and better.”   

    * So if you’re quick to start and slow to finish, that doesn’t make you *unproductive*. It just might make you *original*.
      Originals have plenty of doubt, but what they’re doubting isn’t their own worth, value, or ability. 

- ### Originals don’t doubt themselves, they doubt their ideas. And that’s what makes them so special.

    * Originals know that, at the end of our lives, our biggest regrets are never the things we tried and failed. 
    * They’re the things we were too scared to try in the first place.
    * Bad ideas aren’t really bad. They’re necessary to get from point A to point B exploring as many cul-de-sacs as possible. 
      As Grant observes, **“originals fail the most because they try the most.”**

- ### Originals succeed because of their procrastination, fear, doubt, and bad ideas. Not in spite of them.
